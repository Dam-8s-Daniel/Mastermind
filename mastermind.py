The goal is to guess the sequence of four numbers that are randomly selected from numbers 0 - 7. Duplicates numbers are
possible.You have 10 tries. Every round consists of guessing four numbers. After each round, you'll receive slightly
helpful feedback on the correctness of the numbers. The feedback message will not say which numbers are correct.

The feedback will be one of the three messages:

1. "One or more numbers are correct and are in the correct location"
2. "One or more numbers are correct"
3. "All numbers are incorrect"
